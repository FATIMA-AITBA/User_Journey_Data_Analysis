The functions allow users to filter data by subscription type. The following functions are included:\n","\n","**Page count** : it counts how many times each page can be found in all user journeys.\n","\n","**Page presence** : is similar to ‘page count’ but counts each page only once if it exists in a journey; it shows how many times each page is part of a journey\n","\n","**Page destination**: is a metric that shows the most frequent follow-ups after every page. It looks at every page and counts which pages follow next. If one is interested in what the users do after visiting page X, they can consult this metric.\n","\n","**Page sequences** : look at what the most popular run of N pages is. I will consult this metric if I’m interested in the sequence of three (or any other number) pages that most often shows up. Count each sequence only once per journey.\n","\n","**Journey length** : is a straightforward metric that considers the average length of a user journey in terms of pages.\n","\n","**Entry Page Frequency** : Identifies which pages are most often the starting point of user journeys, useful for understanding how users typically enter the platform or website.\n","\n","**Exit Page Frequency** : Tracks the most common last pages users visit before leaving, Helps detect potential drop-off points or pages where user engagement ends.\n","\n","**Click Depth** : Measures the average number of steps it takes for users to reach key pages (e.g., pricing, contact), Helps assess site structure and accessibility of important content."],"metadata":{"id":"2sSrPhKWK_nZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from collections import Counter"],"metadata":{"id":"5K62I1HEyLA7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743982278156,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"FATIMA AIT BA","userId":"04083776487665113094"}}},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":50,"metadata":{"id":"V3c5jwB9wVKN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743982278453,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":296,"user":{"displayName":"FATIMA AIT BA","userId":"04083776487665113094"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/user-jurney-analysis/clean_data.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"hE2pvMRyyNyl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743982278485,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":34,"user":{"displayName":"FATIMA AIT BA","userId":"04083776487665113094"}},"outputId":"e65d5c09-495d-495f-c60f-55e2e2667de1"},"execution_count":51,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   user_id subscription_type  \\\n","0     1516            Annual   \n","1     3395            Annual   \n","2    10107            Annual   \n","3    11145           Monthly   \n","4    12400           Monthly   \n","\n","                                   full_user_journey  \n","0                     Homepage-Log in-Sign up-Log in  \n","1            Pricing-Sign up-Log in-Homepage-Pricing  \n","2  Homepage-Career tracks-Homepage-Career tracks-...  \n","3    Homepage-Log in-Homepage-Log in-Homepage-Log in  \n","4  Homepage-Career tracks-Sign up-Log in-Career t...
